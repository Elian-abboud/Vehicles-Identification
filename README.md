# Vehicles-Identification
 Smart Border for Vehicles Identification

 An AI system designed to (recognize, identify, count and classify, and features extraction ) vehicles crossing certain borders. By taking advantage of advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms, in addition to estimating the speed at every moment of vehicles in video, the system accurately distinguishes between different types of vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses, bicycles...etc.. Below are the basic components and functions of the project:

1-Object detection using YOLOv8
2-Track objects using ByteTrack
3-Count objects with Supervision
4-Similarity Analysis with Cosine Similarity
5-Speed ​​estimation
